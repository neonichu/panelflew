# PanelFlew

A set of scripts for making CBZ files from your [Panelfly][1] comics.
I used it to migrate away from the app, but keep my purchases. You
should not use it to pirate stuff! Use something like [iFunBox][2]
to get all files from the Documents directory of the Panelfly app
to your Mac, then use these scripts to create the CBZ files. You
are now free to use any app you want for reading them. As I said, 
don't be a dick, those comics were only bought for yourself.
